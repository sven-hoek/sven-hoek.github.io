I never planned to create a blog but once I started tinkering with graphics and animtations with JavaScript on the HTML canvas, I thought it would be nice to easily access them for others to see and play around with them.
So for now, this is not much more than a little playground for those interactive animations.
Possibly, I'll add more educational info or other pieces, otherwise it looks a bit empty and someone may profit from it.

The motivation to start with interactive animations came from [argonaut's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY), who also links to [Sublucid Geometry's blog post about constraints](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/).
They former uses the popular Java graphics library [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the latter uses the JavaScript vector graphics library [paper.js](https://paperjs.org/).
In contrast to that, the animations on this page (so far) are written in plain JavaScript, directly using the Canvas API.
The reason for that is not just that I wanted to see, how far I can get without a library but also because it was easier to draw a circle onto the canvas than to figure out how to use a library in JavaScript.

I also try to structure the code somewhat logically to make it reusable - at least to some extent.
However, it's not supposed to be comletely generic code, or even a library.
Also, with me having my background in other languages, mainly C++, I may not write the most idiomatic JavaScript, so bear with me.
