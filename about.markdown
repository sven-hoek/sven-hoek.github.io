I never really planned to create a blog but one day, I started to learn Javascript and play with the canvas, creating simple procedural, interactive animations.
There were fun to play around with and only need a browser to run, so I thought I could make them accessible for others to play with them too.
This was supposed to just be a little playground for those animations but possibly, I'll add more educational info, otherwise it looks a bit empty and someone may profit from it.

The motivation to start with interactive animations came from [argonaut's videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfh_rv6khY), who also links to [Sublucid Geometry's blog post about constraints](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/).
They former uses the popular Java graphics library [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the latter uses the JavaScript vector graphics library [paper.js](https://paperjs.org/).
In contrast to that, the animations on this page (so far) are written in plain JavaScript, directly using the Canvas API.
The reason for that is not just that I wanted to see, how far I can get without a library but also because it was easier to draw a circle onto the canvas than to figure out how to use a library in JavaScript.
