Touch the screen or move the mouse around to start and interact. Note that scrolling with a touchscreen requires to touch ouside the canvas area.
The simulation bases on simple distance constraints and Verlet integration.
Elements either have a minimum distance (being pushed away from each other) or a maximum distance (being contained with one another), or a fixed distance (the ends of chain links).

Inspired by [Sublucid Geometry's blog post](https://zalo.github.io/blog/constraints/), which has a little more info.
